On Homework 1 i didn't make a new class, i implemented the tests on the already existing class for the 4th seminar.

On Homework 2 i have encountered a bug with eclipse that didn't allow me to view my JUnit tests properly, below is a link to the bug submision: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=525948

Homework 3 is found inside the text document residing in the Homework 3 folder.
